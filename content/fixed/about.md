My name is Mike Janger and I've been infected with the need to make stuff.   A few years ago my wife and I went to a local art fair and I was blown away by the paintings I saw there.   Since then the desire to create stuff has grown.  I finally decided to do something about it by teaching myself how to paint.   I started this blog as a way to document how it goes. 

It's taking some time to figure out what works for me, but I keep trying to move forward.  Hopefully the things I write here will interest or help others.
