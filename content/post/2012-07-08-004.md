Notes:

- Finally put out enough color.
- I had been using wax paper for a palette (acrylics).   This time I used a paper plate with a waxy type coating and found it much better to mix with.
- Still finding it hard to block in the major shapes and nail down proportions.  It's difficult to ignore details.   I'm not spending enough time on this.
- I have a hard time creating the delineation between light and shadow.  It's like I can see it, but can't describe it. 
- Felt lost in painting a couple of times with this one.  That's a first.
- At some point, I need to stop creating these floating objects.  Right now I just want to do and not feel frustrated.
