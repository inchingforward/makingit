I haven't made any posts in a while:  the last few paintings I've made have ended up in the trash.  I try to lay paint down in ways that make sense, but something is always wrong:  perspective, color, value, you name it. 

Tonight I tried making a grisaille of a portrait, hoping to understand values better.   The colors I mixed just seemed wrong when laid down next to each other.   The critic in me got annoyed at my errors and childish-looking output and in frustration I threw another one away.

It's hard being at the beginning.  You look at the works of people that you admire and inspire you and it seems so far from where you are.

I'm not finished, just kinda stuck right now.
