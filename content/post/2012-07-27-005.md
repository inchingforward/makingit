There's so much wrong with this one, but at the same time I feel I've made some progress. 

My daughter and I are starting to get into a rhythm now.   Even though I still get frustrated, the more I paint, the more I want to paint.  I'm now constantly finding myself looking at things and wondering what mixes of colors it would take to paint what my eyes are seeing.  Books are becoming more informative as I have a better understanding of what the authors are trying to say.  There's so much to know.

No paintings for a week: we're taking a much-needed vacation.  I'm hoping to come back energized and armed with some pictures of things to work on.

Today's inspiration:
