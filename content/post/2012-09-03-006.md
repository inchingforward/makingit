Finally an update.  The only positive thing I can think to say about this one is that it was my first experience with oils.  I fought this thing every step of the way for 3 nights.  I lost energy by the time I started on the "leaves" inside the pot.  I need to stop switching paints and stop painting objects floating in space.  On to the next.

Today's inspiration:

The video to [Blown Minded by Young Galaxy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rumNQRfCoqw).  It's an animation done by [Carine Khalif√©](http://www.carinekhalife.net/).  She hand-painted every frame of the video in oil on glass (read the awesome description she provides under the video).  I think I watched it 8 times in a row when I first found it.
