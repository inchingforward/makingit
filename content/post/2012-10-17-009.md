I have a hard time "seeing" values.  For this one, I premixed 5 values of Van Dyke Brown and Titanium White without considering the actual values of the pumpkin just to see how it would turn out.   I may do some more of this little pumpkin.   I haven't posted as much lately, even though I've been painting.  I'm still throwing away paintings that really bother me.

Today's Inspiration:

The [Your Dreams My Nightmares podcast](http://yourdreamsmynightmares.com/) by [Sam Weber](http://sampaints.com/).  Sam asks great questions in his interviews with working illustrators and those within the field.   Highly recommended.
