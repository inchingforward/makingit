I found [this flower picture](http://mrg.bz/YxP2aQ) on [morgueFile](http://morguefile.com/) and thought it'd be easy enough to paint.  Golden OPEN and Heavy Body acrylics on acrylic paper.  I love the colors Heavy Body can make, but really dislike the drying time.  The only reason I used it was because I ran out of OPEN Titanium White.
