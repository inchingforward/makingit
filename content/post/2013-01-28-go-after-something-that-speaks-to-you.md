One of my favorites is [Greg Manchess](http://manchess.com/).  I love the buttery, loose application of paint he uses.   In [this Muddy Colors post](http://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2012/02/frank-duveneck-study.html) he credits [Frank Duveneck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Duveneck) as the reason why he paints the way he does.   I found the above quote in the comments of the post.
