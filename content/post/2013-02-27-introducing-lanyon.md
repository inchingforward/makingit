The Draw Like a Boss Kickstarter is really well done:

> Just keep asking yourself, "What is the simplest way to approach this?"
> 
> Before I learned of this step by step methodology, I was pretty much goinground in circles, honing a style but not improving my drawing.
> 
> ...I wanted to make a tutorial that was more approachable, open and fun. Above all, I wanted to make it accessible for someone like myself: a visual learner who is a little dyslexic. 

Trying to figure this stuff out sure helps with a map--which they literally provide.
